Unreleased
==========

* [#176](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/176)
  + Enabled `autolink` extension for `cmark-gfm`, so now we're finding strings
  like `www.google.com` or `https://google.com`, treating them as links
  and checking.
* [#175](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/175)
  + Reorganize top-level config keys.
* [#178](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/178)
  + Rename exclusion-related config options.
* [#183](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/183)
  + Add support for image links.
* [#199](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/199)
  + Now annotation
  `<!-- xrefcheck: ignore all -->` instead of `<!-- xrefcheck: ignore file -->`
  should be used to disable checking for links in file, so it's clearer that
  file itself is not ignored (and links can target it).
* [#215](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/215)
  + Now we notify user when there are scannable files that were not added to Git
  yet. Also added CLI option `--include-untracked` to scan such files and treat
  as existing.
* [#191](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/191)
  + Now we consider slash `/` (and only it) as path separator in local links for all OS,
    so xrefcheck's report is OS-independent
  + Use utf-8 compatible codepage on Windows
* [#224](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/224)
  + Now the program output does not contain unicode characters that are not widely supported.
* [#229](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/229)
  + Now we call references to anchors in current file (e.g. `[a](#b)`) as
  `file-local` references instead of calling them `current file` (which was ambiguous).
* [#233](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/233)
  + Now xrefxcheck does not follow redirect links by default. It fails for permanent
    redirect responses (i.e. 301 and 308) and passes for temporary ones (i.e. 302, 303, 307).
* [#231](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/231)
  + Anchor analysis takes now into account the appropriate case-sensitivity depending on
  the configured Markdown flavour.
* [#245](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/245)
  + Now xrefcheck is able to detect possible copy-pastes relying on links and their names.

0.2.2
==========

* [#145](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/145)
  + Add check that there is no unknown fields in config.
* [#158](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/158)
  + Fixed bug when we reported footnotes as broken links.
* [#163](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/163)
  + Fixed an issue where the progress bar thread might be unexpectedly cancelled and jumble up the output.
* [#184](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/184)
  + Make `flavor` a required parameter.
* [#182](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/182)
  + Now we call references to anchors in current file (e.g. `[a](#b)`) as
  `current file` references instead of calling them `local` (which was ambiguous).
* [#188](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/188)
  + Added CLI option `--no-colors` that disables ANSI colors in output.
  + Automatically disable coloring if it is not supported
* [#152](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/152)
  + Now we report links that target a file outside repository (e.g. `/../a.md`)
    as broken (with message `Link targets a local file outside repository`).
    Same for links that are using directories outside repository (e.g. `/../repo/a.md`),
    since such things are not supported by GitHub markdown renderer.
* [#174](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/174)
  + Make xrefcheck only scan files that are tracked by git.
  + Fixed bug where links to ignored files were valid.
  + Fixed bug where links with trailing slashes were invalid.
* [#198](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/198)
  + Now we're checking globs in config fields and CLI args (e.g. `ignored`),
    they must be valid globs relative to repository root (`foo/*` instead of `/foo/*`)
* [#196](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/196)
  + Now `xrefcheck: ignore link` annotation expects a link to ignore in next markdown node,
    instead of expecting link in whole rest of file.
    If you've got `Expected a LINK after "ignore link" annotation` message, see
    PR's description for examples and details.
