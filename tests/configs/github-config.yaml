  defaultRetryAfter: 30s

  # How many attempts to retry an external link after getting
  # a "429 Too Many Requests" response.
  # Timeouts may also be accounted here, see the description
  # of `maxTimeoutRetries` field.

  # If a site once responded with 429 error code, subsequent
  # request timeouts will also be treated as hitting the site's
  # rate limiter and result in retry attempts, unless the
  # maximum retries number has been reached.

  # Querying a given domain that ever returned 429 before,
  # this defines how many timeouts are allowed during retries.
  #
  # For such domains, timeouts likely mean hitting the rate limiter,
  # and so xrefcheck considers timeouts in the same way as 429 errors.
  #
  # For other domains, a timeout results in a respective error, no retry
  # attempts will be performed. Use `externalRefCheckTimeout` option
  # to increase the time after which timeout is declared.
  #
  # This option is similar to `maxRetries`, the difference is that
  # this `maxTimeoutRetries` option limits only the number of retries
  # caused by timeouts, and `maxRetries` limits the number of retries
  # caused both by 429s and timeouts.

  #     redirection step. Its absence also means that every link matches.
  #   - 'on' accepts 'temporary', 'permanent' or a specific redirect HTTP code.
  #     Its absence also means that every response code matches.
  #   - 'outcome' accepts 'valid', 'invalid' or 'follow'. The last one follows
  #      the redirect by applying the same configuration rules so, for instance,
  #      exclusion rules would also apply to the following links.

  # The first one that matches is applied, and the link is considered
