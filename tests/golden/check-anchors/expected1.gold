     Ambiguous reference to anchor 'some-text'
       In file a.md
       It could refer to either:
         - some-text (header I) at src:6:1-11
         - some-text (header I) at src:8:1-15
         - some-text (header II) at src:12:1-12
       Use of ambiguous anchors is discouraged because the target
       can change silently while the document containing it evolves.
